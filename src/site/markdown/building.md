# Building Phoenix Project

Phoenix is a fully mavenized project. That means you can build simply by doing:
```
 $ mvn package
```

builds, test and package Phoenix and put the resulting jars (phoenix-[version].jar and phoenix-[version]-client.jar) in the generated target/ directory.

To build, but skip running the tests, you can do:
```
 $ mvn package -DskipTests
```
To only build the generated parser (i.e. <code>PhoenixSQLLexer</code> and <code>PhoenixSQLParser</code>), you can do:
```
 $ mvn process-sources
```

To build an Eclipse project, install the m2e plugin and do an File->Import...->Import Existing Maven Projects selecting the root directory of Phoenix.
